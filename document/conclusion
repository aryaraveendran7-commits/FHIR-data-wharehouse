The migration of RMHC legacy data into a FHIR-based ecosystem demonstrates the critical role of semantic integrity in modern healthcare information systems. By eliminating magic strings and replacing them with coded values governed by CodeSystems, ConceptMaps, and the FHIR $translate operation, the solution ensures that clinical meaning is preserved consistently across systems.

The defined system architecture and data movement process clearly separate data ingestion, semantic translation, and resource construction, reducing dependency on application-specific logic. The STM mapping approach provides traceability, auditability, and repeatability, making the migration process transparent and maintainable.

As a result, the translated data becomes interoperable, analytics-ready, and future-proof, enabling seamless integration with HMIS, EHR, reporting platforms, and public health systems. This approach not only minimizes clinical and operational risk but also establishes a scalable foundation for long-term digital health transformation.
